## Description
This project is a CLI that will create html code based on questions answered.  The user has to enter a manager and his/her info, then is asked to enter engineers and interns.  When the user answers that they are complete, an html file is created in the /output folder.

In addition, my portfolio has been updated with this project.  The portfolio is located at https://jdeleonardis.github.io/portfolio.html.

## Installation
No installation required.

## Usage
This application should be run by typing 'node app.js' from a node terminal.  The project uses the inquirer module to ask a series of questions about employees.

## Tests
There are 5 separate tests that have been created for this project, all located in the /test folder.  The tests should be executed by typing 'node run tests' from the terminal.

In addition to the tests provided by the project requirements, I have added several individual test cases to each test file that tests that the objects are created correctly.
